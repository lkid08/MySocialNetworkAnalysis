# MySocialNetworkAnalysis
This is a social network analysis I performed using Python and networkx.

I used my list of 100 of my friends and their mutual connections to form an Ego network, selected the largest connected component and performed an analysis of this network. 

The structural analysis and community detection showed that there were 4 distinct social groups in my network (based on their affiliation: my school, BSc university, MSc university, and partner's university).

The largest social group were my school friends: a tightly-knit group with little variation.

The nodes of people who did not interact with everyone for the full duration of an 11-year education (teachers or friends who switched schools) had less influence.
